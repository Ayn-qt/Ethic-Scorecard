# Ethic-Scorecard
Internship Project
Project overview 
This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that assesses ethical dilemmas by integrating core ethical teachings from major world religions. The system generates an Ethics Score reflecting how different religious traditions might evaluate the morality of complex scenarios. The goal is to support policymakers, AI developers, and decision-makers in navigating ethically sensitive issues with diverse cultural insights, fostering more inclusive and responsible AI governance.
